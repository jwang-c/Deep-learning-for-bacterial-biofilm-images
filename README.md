The real biofilm dataset is obtained by lattice light sheet microscopy from [BCM3D](https://github.com/GahlmannLab/BCM3D). The binary cell label images are generated by [CellModeller](https://haselofflab.github.io/CellModeller/). Post-processing of the segmentation results option with [m-LCuts](https://github.com/jwang-c/mlcuts).


More details are coming up soon. Thank you for your patience!
