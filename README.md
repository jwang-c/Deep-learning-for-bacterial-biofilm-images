# 3D GAN image synthesis and dataset quality assessment for bacterial biofilm
Deep learning for analyzing bacterial biofilm images, including 3D GAN image synthesis, dataset quality assessment with SSQA, and a 3D u-net practice for cell segmentation.

The real biofilm dataset is obtained by lattice light sheet microscopy from [BCM3D](https://github.com/GahlmannLab/BCM3D). The binary cell label images are generated by [CellModeller](https://haselofflab.github.io/CellModeller/).


More details are coming up soon. Thank you for your patience!
